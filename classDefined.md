### **Play of Classes, Superclasses, Functions, and the API**

The provided implementation is a modular and layered system that uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and functional components. Here's how the classes, superclasses, functions, and the API work together:

---

### **1. RTScheduler: The Base Scheduler Class**

#### Role:
- The `RTScheduler` serves as the base class for implementing scheduling algorithms. Purpose is to encapsulate core scheduling logic, such as task management, priority queuing, and deadline tracking.

#### Working:
- **Priority Queue (`task_queue`)**: Manages tasks based on priority.
- **Lock (`lock`)**: Ensures thread-safe access to shared resources.
- **Missed Deadlines (`missed_deadlines`)**: Tracks the count of tasks that failed to complete within their deadlines.
- **Core Methods**:
  - `add_task`: Adds a task with priority and optional deadline.
  - `execute_task`: Executes tasks in priority order, handling locking, logging, and deadlines.

#### Purpose:
- The `RTScheduler` serves as the **superclass** for all scheduling algorithms, providing a reusable foundation. Each algorithm customizes its behavior by overriding the `add_task` method to define unique priority calculations.

---

### **2. EDFScheduler, RMScheduler, and DMScheduler: Subclasses of RTScheduler**

#### Role:
- Each subclass represents a specific real-time scheduling algorithm by overriding the `add_task` method to adjust priority calculation logic.

#### Relation with the Superclass:
- Subclasses inherit the `execute_task` method and the infrastructure (e.g., task queue, locking) from `RTScheduler`.
- They extend and modify the `add_task` method for their scheduling strategy:
  - **EDFScheduler**: Uses the formula `priority = deadline - current_time`.
  - **RMScheduler**: Uses `priority = 1 / period` (shorter periods → higher priority).
  - **DMScheduler**: Uses `priority = deadline` (direct mapping).

---

### **3. SchedulerAPI: The Interface for Managing Schedulers**

#### Role:
- The `SchedulerAPI` acts as a central **interface** for managing and switching between multiple schedulers.

#### Features added:
- **Dynamic Addition**:
  - You can add multiple scheduler instances (e.g., `EDF`, `RMS`, `DMS`) to the API at runtime using `add_scheduler`.
- **Switching**:
  - Use `switch_scheduler` to dynamically change the active scheduler based on conditions.

#### How It Fits:
- The `SchedulerAPI` decouples the scheduling logic from external systems. Instead of interacting directly with individual schedulers, external components (e.g., `manage_scheduling`) interact with the API.
- It makes the system extensible and modular by allowing new schedulers to be added easily.

#### Example Workings from the original code:
```python
api = SchedulerAPI()
api.add_scheduler("EDF", edf_scheduler)
current_scheduler = api.switch_scheduler("EDF")
current_scheduler.execute_task()
```

---

### **4. manage_scheduling: Real-Time Monitoring and Scheduler Control**

#### Role:
- The `manage_scheduling` function acts as the **control logic** for monitoring system metrics and dynamically switching between schedulers based on real-time conditions.

#### Play with API:
- Uses the `SchedulerAPI` to switch schedulers dynamically:
  - Retrieves the current scheduler using `api.switch_scheduler(current_scheduler)`.
  - Calls the selected scheduler’s `execute_task` method to execute tasks.

#### Flow:
1. Monitor metrics like CPU utilization, task wait times, and missed deadlines.
2. Decide which scheduler to use based on thresholds.
3. Switch to the chosen scheduler and execute tasks.
4. Log decisions and metrics.

---

### **5. Function Definitions: Task Simulation**

#### Role:
- Functions like `read_temperature`, `read_humidity`, and `read_wind_speed` simulate tasks that the schedulers manage.
- These tasks are added to the schedulers, and their execution is logged during `execute_task`.

#### How They Fit:
- Tasks represent the workload managed by schedulers.
- They help demonstrate how schedulers handle task prioritization, execution, and deadlines.

---

### **6. Integration of Components**

#### **Initialization and Configuration**:
- Create scheduler instances:
  ```python
  edf_scheduler = EDFScheduler("EDF")
  rm_scheduler = RMScheduler("RMS")
  dm_scheduler = DMScheduler("DMS")
  ```
- Add schedulers to `SchedulerAPI`:
  ```python
  api = SchedulerAPI()
  api.add_scheduler("EDF", edf_scheduler)
  api.add_scheduler("RMS", rm_scheduler)
  api.add_scheduler("DMS", dm_scheduler)
  ```

#### **Task Management**:
- Add tasks to schedulers:
  ```python
  edf_scheduler.add_task(read_temperature, deadline=time.time() + 10)
  rm_scheduler.add_task(read_humidity, period=5)
  dm_scheduler.add_task(read_wind_speed, deadline=15)
  ```

#### **Dynamic Scheduling**:
- Use `manage_scheduling` to monitor metrics and switch schedulers dynamically.

#### **Execution Flow**:
1. The control thread (`manage_scheduling`) monitors the system.
2. Based on metrics, it switches schedulers via `SchedulerAPI`.
3. The active scheduler executes tasks in priority order.

This modular design enables a clear separation of concerns, making the system scalable, flexible, and maintainable. Each component contributes to real-time scheduling while remaining loosely coupled for easy extensions or modifications.
